In his book *the Meditations* (the best translation is by Gregory Hays, 2012 Modern Library, first came out in 2002) we see that central to Marcus' philosophy is the doctrine of the three "disciplines": the disciplines of perception, of action and of the will.

1. Perception: see things as they are, not as we judge them to be. For example lightning hitting a house is just lightning hitting a house, it is us who say if it's good or bad. What we decide to call it is our interpretation.

Objects and what happens isn't the problem, it's the interpretations we place on them that are.

This is the same with animals like snakes. They are neither good nor bad until people put judgement on them. Many cultures throughout history have revered them. These days most people are terrified of them. But this is their choice as it is their interpretation. 

Our job in life is to control our perception to protect our mind from error.

2. Action: relates to our relationships with others. The only thing in life that we can control is our own actions. We control our own actions and are responsible for them. So this is where our focus should be. 

When we act wrongly, we harm ourselves - nobody else.

And as we are social animals we exist not for ourselves but for others, our nature is fundamentally unselfish.

Human society is a single organism. We are not all equal. That doesn't require a judgment that some are better or worse than others, rather its a recognition that we have value for our differences. Just like hands and feet have different purposes on a body, so do people in society.

3. Will: relates to what is *not* in our control. These things can't hurt us. Bad acts by others (torture, theft, crime, anything) harm them not us. Acts of nature like fire or death can only harm us if we *choose* to see them as harmful.

Rather, we should see things as they are (perception) and then control only what we can (action).

As Alexander Pope said "whatever is, is right."

And as Marcus Aurelius wrote: "Objective judgement, Unselfish action, Willing acceptance."

This goes even for death
