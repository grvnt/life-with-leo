I'm sitting on the couch here where you and I were today. I'm writing this letter to you to try and explain why I left Sweden.

Why I had to leave.

For context your mom and I split up almost exactly a year ago when you were just 8 months old.

That was a devestating time for me. I had to leave my home, my baby boy. I had no one and nothing else in Sweden. No friends, no family, no car, no home. I had two weeks to start from scratch. But your dad is no stranger to change, to moving, to starting over, or to being alone.

Sometimes you just gotto roll with the punches and go wth the flow. Nothing in life, [except our actions](Life/Perception-Action-Will.md#action), is under our control.

I won't say it was easy. As it was I was only just recovering from a long battle with depression. Before coming to Sweden the world had closed down because of lockdown and countries were closing their borders because of covid.

My life was amazing. I was living my dream as a professional paraglider pilot and i'd just met your mom. We were both madly in love and planning our future together. We had just moved into a new apartment in Cape Town. She was in London getting her work visa - but then covid hit.

Your mom had to return to Sweden and I wasn't aloud to leave the apartment for 3 months. Eventually your mom decided not to come back to South Africa so I followed my heart and moved to Sweden. My plan was to keep flying paragliders in Sweden and Europe. 

However, the reality was to be far more brutal than that. 

In the fours years that I've been here I've hardly flown. Society is so different here. I have no friends and I'm very lonely. I hardly get to see you. 

Even though I have a degree in nature conservation and years of experience in the field, I've been unable to find work. And the paragliding schools here haven't even been open to me volunteering for them. 

I started my own business but it didn't take off. I studied cyber security, web development and photography in my spare time. I was depserately chasing to try and find some contentment in my life in Sweden.

I got a job as a face to face fund raiser. Then I worked as a delivery driver and then a warehouse worker. I tried to get work as a tandem pilot in Tenerife but I couldn't get a work permit with my british passport.

I've been struggling financially and spiritually for a long time. 

Most days after work I go to the supermarket before I go home just to have something to do.

This was all far removed from the adventurous and expansive life I had in South Africa. The life that I want you to know and to experience. 

The life of friendly people, an open society, and a life of adventure. The bokke. The ocean. The mountains. The wildlife. The culture. The food. The music. The language. All of it. 

I think you'll see what I mean one day.

I tried hard to make it work here. In fact, it's been an immense period of growth for me. I've learned so much about myself and about life. To develop myself more I started listening to audio books when I started delivery driving. I continued to do that when I worked in the warehouse.

And it changed my life.

Sweden has been my retreat. It's through the hard times that we grow and evolve if we choose to.

So, I don't regret anything. Not following my heart nor having you. You are the greatest gift I've ever received. Which is why this is so difficult. 

But my time here is up.

I can barely afford my rent. I have to borrow money often to make ends meet. That means I can't even provide for you like you deserve. I'm doing the best that I can right now but I feel like I'm drowning.

It's unhealthy for me to stay here. We are designed to live in community. We need to find our place and be with our people.

And my people are in South Africa. They are your people too. One day you'll understand.

I'm not sure what the future holds. I'm not sure where I'll end up. But I do know that I'll always love you and that I'll always do my best to be the best dad I can be.

I'll always be your dad.

I love you son.
