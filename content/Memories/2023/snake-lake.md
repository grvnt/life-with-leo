As you'll learn your Dad loves wildlife, especially the 'underdogs' - the misunderstood creatures. Maybe because I felt misunderstood growing up.

To me it's amazing how two people can see the same thing but look ayt and experience it in completely different ways.

I try not to handle every animal as it does stress them out, but sometimes I can't help myself especially when I think someone can benefit from seeing it.

In this case it was your mom's friend Sandra and her daughter Selma. I saw the snake swimming in the lake and I bolted off impulsively without thinking. I followed it into the shallows and immediately could tell it was a non-venomous grass snake.

But as I went to grab it I stepped on a tuft of grass and something happened...

I was chest deep in the lake. The grass I stood on was floating reeds not part of the bank 😂 My phone was in my pocket. In that instant I figured the phone coouldn't get any more wet so I climbed out of the water with one hand holding the bank and the other holding the snake.

I really hope I get to experience nature with you like this one day.

It's one of the reasons I'm going back to South Africa, to build a life so that you might experience the awe and wonder that this life has to offer. 

You have the bush inside you my boy, just like your dad and your grandad did.

Love, always 🐍
