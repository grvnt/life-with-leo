One day at the lake you went into the changing cubicle to hide.

I called out Leeeeooo, where are yoooou?

You laughed and loved it.

But you couldn't say Leo and you didn't quite get it was your name, it was as if you thought the name of the game was eeeawww.

So that's what you have been saying up until now whenever you want to play hide and seek with me.

Sometimes, I'll build the cushions on the couch up to make a tunnel and we will play eeeeawwww, which you will often ask me for by saying eeeawww.

It's the cutest.
