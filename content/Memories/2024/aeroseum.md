We've been having so much fun together. We have all these little looks and jokes and you even use Swedish and English sometimes to make sure I understand you. 

Like you'll say, vatten-water, if you're thirsty. Very cute.

As you see here, you LOVE things with engines. But especially aeroplanes and motorbikes which you call mope(d) and bigkam (flygplan). 

Your Uncle Dave, cousins Janet & Ruth are all airline pilots, you grandad Phil dreamt of being a helicopter pilot, but when he couldn't he became a paratrooper with over 300 jumps!

Your dad somehow discovered and fell in love with paragliding.

So you're in great Smith company my boy with your love of planes. 

Maybe you'll fly something too one day :)

Hope you enjoy these memories.

I love you.

Dad.
