Hi boy, 

This week I've decided to put together some video clips of our weekend together. The main takeaway is that no matter what happens, no matter how long we are apart, my love for you will never fade.

I cannot explain the feeling I have when I'm not with you, it's like a deep ache - not quite painful, but a rich and strong feeling mixed with longing and sometimes a type of emptiness. It's hard and beautiful at the same time.

And while it's tough not to see you, I'm so grateful for these moments that we share.
