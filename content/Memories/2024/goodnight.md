There's very little that compares with you sleeping soundly in your travel cot next to my bed. 

It's been quite the little adventure. My place gets hot like an oven, so I bought you fan which quickly became one of your favourite toys. :)

The first night you struggled to sleep a little with the change, but after that you adapted quite easily. First, we would read. Then after a few books I'd put you in there. Of course you'd try to escape but you weren't sad. 

I put my pillow at the foot of the bed so I could lay next to you and put my arm on you or rub your back. It took time though. You would march back and forth, saying your cute [[sounds]] before throwing bunny down out the cot and down the stairs followed by panda. 

Like a sumo, you'd then belly flop with your face into the mattress. At first I got a fright thinking you'd be hurt - it was such a loud thud - but you loved it, it was soothing in some way ðŸ¤£

Dad would just lie there paitently, sometimes singing or humming, sometimes quiet depending on how you were responding. 

And when you woke up, your [[firstwords]] were always boookah. You loved reading with me.

I speak about it now as I write this in the past as I really haven't got enough of that, and while I wish I had more time with you it hasn't worked out that way. 

But there is no point on dwelling on what is out of your control. I'm so grateful to have experienced even one second with you. These memories are some of my most precious and writing this to you brings me that little bit closer when you aren't here.

Every single night, I kiss this photo and say goodnight to you. 

This photo is very special as it was your first real smile. You can see how much I love you and how happy you are to receive my love.

I always love you little guy.

Dad.
