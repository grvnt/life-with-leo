We had another amazing weekend together!

You made me laugh like never before with your cheeky looks. You said BOKKE! for the first time. You tried to eat everything. We went to the zoo, saw dinosaurs, lions, giraffes, and all sorts of animals. 

We laughed, played, ate lots of apples off the neighbourhood tree, read books, kicked the ball and cuddled on the couch.

Love you my boy - enjoy the video :)
