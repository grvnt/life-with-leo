Hi boy,

I've been pushing to try and get more calls with you. They don't beat real contact I know but we're making the most with what we have right now. 

It's amazing how each time we call you seem to be more aware. The first few times you were a little shy, as if confused and withdrawn.

Now when you see me you instantly smile, say - "Papa!" and laugh when we do our little jokes like the [[rocketship]] and [[bellybelly]].

Love you,
Dad
