Before your [[firstwords]] you made a lot of [[sounds]].

Actually, you had one or two that you would repeat aaaaallll day long :)

One day we were reading a little wooden book that we got from your Auntie [[Vornie]] and Cousin [[Joshua]]. You weren't really interested in most of it except for the car and the aeroplane.

When I did the rocket sound and flew the rocket over your head and in the room you loved it!! The sound quickly became your favourite.

When we were together or when we video called I could always pull out that sound and you would laugh and repeat it back to me.

Then it got even better when we had a thundery weekend. Just before going to bed thunder cracked loudly, you looked up a made sound with a happy look on your face. The video below is the thunder and rocket sound together.

Yes, you were the cutest ever.

Sometimes we would just make rocket noises at eachother for ages until we started laughing. We would pull funny faces and get our noses close to eachother while doing it.

You wont remember it, but that rocket picture will always have a special place in my heart.
