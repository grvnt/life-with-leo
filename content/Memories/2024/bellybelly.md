One hot day you we came home after being at the park and lake all day. It was hot so you were in your nappy and I was in shorts.

You were playing [[eeeeawwww]] when I suddenly grabbed and hugged you belly to belly. You laughed and when I said belly belly, you said bulllyyy. 

It was so cute and it became one of our jokes that we would do while on [[videocalls]].
